When in the correct directory (my-app)

When made changes and want to apply them to test
- ionic build        # Builds your app
- ionic cap sync     # Syncs changes to native projects

In the terminal in VScode write the following to open the dev studio to test with an emulator in that environment
- ionic capacitor open ios     # Opens in Xcode
- ionic capacitor open android # Opens in Android Studio

To run the app in a browser to preview how it should look write
-  ionic serve
